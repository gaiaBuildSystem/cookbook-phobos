# aktualizr-torizon Recipe

This directory contains a Gaia cookbook for building the Torizon team customization of Aktualizr.

As PhobOS is designed to be compatible with the Torizon update system, this recipe just build and installs the Torizon version of Aktualizr.

## SBOM

This cookbook does not need a specific recipe for SBOM generation because the build process generates a .deb package that at the end of the Gaia build will be included in the final SBOM.
